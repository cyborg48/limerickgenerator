    <h1 id = "title"><a href="welcome.html">Welcome to the Limerick Generator</a></h1>

    <p>Developed by a bored sixteen year old who loves programming as much as she does poetry, this site retrieves from three APIs:
    databuse.com, Merriam Webster's dictionary API at dictionaryapi.com, and the English conjugation API at https://lt-nlgservice.herokuapp.com/. Because of all of this checking and retrieving, the limericks can take quite a while to load. Animations on the site freeze when the limerick starts loading but fear not for they will unfreeze once the algorithm stops. I am working on making this bit more smooth. And if the limerick does not load, simply try again (or change the name to something more easy-to-rhyme if you are using a custom name) - poetry is hard for machines as well as humans!</p>

    <p>Enter a name for a custom limerick! Works best with short names that rhyme with a lot of words.</p>
